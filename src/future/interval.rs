//! This is almost the exact code of the tokio Interval implementation with a simple difference:
//!
//! In scavenger we request the `MiningInfo` in a certain interval. If the pool or wallet is not
//! available in a certain time frame the request will take longer than `Interval`. As soon as the
//! pool or wallet is available a bunch of requests are going to be fired at once.
//!
//! Here we delay once an item has been processed, e.g.:
//! 1. We have a interval of 3s.
//! 2. We fire our request at time = 0s.
//! 3. We timeout after time = 10s
//! 4. We fire our next request at time t = 13s
