- AVX512, AVX2, AVX, SSE2 and NEON **SIMD optimizations**
- Multi-threaded & high performance I/O
- Integrated plot reader, CPU miner & buffer pipeline
- Full async + **Tokio** + **crossbeam** architecture

## üß∞ **Feature Overview**

| Architecture     | Feature(s)               | Description                            |
|------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| x86 (Intel/AMD)  | sse2, avx, avx2, avx512f | SIMD extensions for Desktop/Server CPUs |
| ARM (e.g. Pi)    | neon                    | SIMD for ARM CPUs                      |




| Variant  | Description                                              | CPU Availability                            |

## üì¶ **Installation**

### üñ•Ô∏è Precompiled Binaries

‚û°Ô∏è [Go to Releases](https://github.com/signum-network/signum-miner/releases)

Download the binary matching your system:

For Linux distributions:
- `signum-miner-avx` 
- `signum-miner-avx2`
- `signum-miner-avx512f` (modern CPUs)
- `signum-miner-sse2` (legacy CPUs)
- ` signum-miner-aarch64-neon` (ARM)

For Windows distributions one of the `.exe` versions:
- `signum-miner-avx` 
- `signum-miner-avx2`
- `signum-miner-avx512f` (modern CPUs)
- `signum-miner-sse2` (legacy CPUs)

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Running the binaries**

### Config

The miner needs a **config.yaml** file.</br>
Please download from the corresponding release.

### Running
Be sure to have the config file on the same folder of your binary.</br>

For windows, double click on the executable file.</br>
If it refuses to run, start the executable from a command prompt to check for error messages.</br>
For Linux run it with the folliwing command:</br>
```shell
./signum-miner
```

## üíª Build from Source
 - First you need to install a Rust stable toolchain, check https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.
 - Binaries are in **target/debug** or **target/release** depending on optimization.

```bash
# Install Rust
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/signum-network/signum-miner
cd signum-miner

# decide on features to run/build:
simd: support for SSE2, AVX, AVX2 and AVX512F (x86_cpu)
neon: support for Arm NEON (arm_cpu)

# Build with desired features (choose one!)
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features simd_avx

# Default Build with avx2 features 
cargo build --release 
```
